fans or potential fans can be able to chat with band while they visit the webpage. A robot feature will be added in feature

Posted this Stack Overflow thread explained that it is just an information that imported style sheet will not be validated.

These warnings remain unresolved
I have conducted enough testing and i strongly believe that the site works properly and as intended to be.

The website works perfectly on as intended. It is responsive and works on different screens. 
-iPad Pro, iPad, iPad Mini (portrait & landscape);

iPhone 5/SE (portrait; each column takes the full width on the row)

iPhone 6/7/8 (portrait each column takes the full width on the row)

iPhone 6/7/8 Plus (portrait; each column takes the full width on the row)

iPhone X (portrait each column take the full width on the row)

Large screens (Each row has 3-4 columns)
