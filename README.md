### Features Left to Implement
I plan on allowing the photo feature to be clickable in other for the user to have a wider or larger view of the photos.As seen in 
the webpage. The photos  clickable as intended but will be implemented in the near future. I would like to also implement a live chat section where
fans or potential fans can be able to chat with band while they visit the webpage. A robot feature will be added in feature

## Testing

I have conducted enough testing and i strongly believe that the site works properly and as intended to be. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Comments
    1. "Go to the Events page" scroll down the page and go to the comment section
    2. "Fill in an empty field and press the submit button"
    3. "A thank you for submitting mesage will be displayed below"
   
2. Booking 
   1. Go to the Events Page" scroll down the page to the 

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
