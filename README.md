This website is a responsive website designed for an Austrailian based band with the aim of increasing their fan base with their
music resonating with their fans when they listen to the audio and video files added on the webpage.

The website aims at targeting potential fans and giving them a feel of the band events and an opportunity to connect with them.
 


The website consist of four Pages:

1. Home page: This page consist of information about "The Band", the teams ,photos, videos and links to their social media pages.

3. Media: The media page consist of photos, audios , videos and links to their social media platforms.

Each page in the website has a link to their social media platforms.

### Features left to Implement

I plan on allowing the photo feature to be clickable in other for the user to have a wider or larger view of the photos.As seen in 
the webpage. The photo is currently not clickable as intended but will be implemented in the near future. I would like to also implement a live chat section where
fans or potential fans can be able to chat with band while they visit the webpage. A robot feature will be added in feature


## Technologies Used

* HTML5 - It was used in defining the structure of the project.

* CSS - I used cascading style sheet(CSS) to style the project.



## Libraries

- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Font Awesome](https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css)

- [Bootstrap cdn](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css)


## Framework

- [Bootstrap]

## Other

- Am I Responsive - Online tool was used to display the project on various devices;

- Balsamiq - The software was used to create the project mockup and Wireframes

## Testing

## Code Validation

## CSS

CSS code was validated using the W3C CSS [Validation Service- Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

In the process of validation the CSS code, the following warning appeared: 
"Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes". 
Warning was investigated and this Stack Overflow thread explained that it is just an information that imported style sheet will not be validated.

Also, this warning remains unresolved: "hover is an unknown vendor extension" since the validator does not recognise vendor specific extensions.
I have conducted enough testing and i strongly believe that the site works properly and as intended to be. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:



In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
